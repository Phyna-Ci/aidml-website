              We may associate your Device identifiers or mobile phone number with your Lugah account.</p>
            <p>Log Information: We may record or log information from your Devices, their software, and your activity
              accessing or using our Services. This information may include:
              • The Device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address
              • Identification numbers associated with your Devices
              • Device event information, such as crashes, system activity, and hardware settings
              • Location preferences

            <p><strong>Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></p>
            <p>We use cookies to personalize our Services for you and to collect aggregate information about usage of
              our Services. A cookie is a text file or other local storage identifier provided by your browser or
              associated applications. We use cookies for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your use
              of our Services. The cookies assign random, unique numbers to your Devices to enable our systems to
              recognize your Devices and to allow us to see how you use our Services.</p>
            <p>The cookies we use in connection with our Services include:
              Session cookies: Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire and are automatically erased whenever
              you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant users access to content and to enable
              actions they must be logged into their Lugah account to perform.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong></em> Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date in the
              distant future and remain in your browser until they expire, or you manually delete them. We use
              persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve our Services. For example, we may
              use a persistent cookie to associate you with your Lugah account or to remember your choices for our
              Services.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Third-party cookies:</strong></em> We permit certain third parties to place cookies through
              our Services to provide us with better insights into the use of our Services and user demographics and to
              advertise our Services to you. These third parties may collect information about your online activities
              over time and across different websites when you access or use our Services. For example, we utilize
              Google Analytics to analyse usage patterns for our Services. Google Analytics generates a cookie to
              capture information about your use of our Services, which Google uses to compile reports on website
              activity for us and to provide other related services. Google may use a portion of your IP address to
              identify its cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google.
              We may also permit third-party service providers to place cookies for our Services, as indicated above, to
              perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified of them and you have consented to the
              usage. We do not control the use of such third-party cookies or the resulting information, and we are not
              responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies on your Devices as described
              in this Privacy Policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies through our Services, you may control how
              your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser.
              Unless you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, our system may issue cookies when you access
              or use our Services. If you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, the performance of certain
              features of our Services may be limited or not work at all.</p>
            <h4><strong><strong>2. How We Use Information</strong></strong></h4>

              business relations, unless you withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications as provided in

              successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information
              unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note however

            <p>Our Services may also allow you to connect with us on, share on, and use third-party websites,

            <p>We have suitable security measures in place to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally
              lost or used or accessed in an unauthorised way by a third party. When your bank account information is
              transmitted via our Services, it will be protected by encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer
              (SSL). In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
              other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Information on
              our instructions. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will
              notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
            <p>We have, and require our third-party service providers that receive Personal Information from us to have,
              a comprehensive written information security program that contains administrative, technical, and physical
              safeguards for our respective physical facilities and in our respective computer systems, databases, and
              communications networks that are reasonably designed to protect information contained within such systems
              from loss, misuse, or alteration</p>
            <p>No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute
              security of your Personal Information. You also play a role in protecting your Personal Information.
              Please safeguard your username and password for your Lugah account and do not share them with others. If
              we receive instructions using your Lugah account login information, we will consider that you have
              authorized the instructions. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Lugah
              account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to refuse to
              provide our Services, terminate Lugah, and to remove or edit content.</p>
            <p>Subject to applicable law, which might, from time to time, oblige us to store your Personal Information
              for a certain period of time, we will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil
              the purposes we collected it for, including the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
              requirements.</p>

              allow third-party websites or applications to link to our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy
              practices of any third parties or the content of linked websites, but we do encourage you to read the
              applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties and websites. This Privacy Policy
